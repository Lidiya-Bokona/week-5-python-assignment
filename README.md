# OOP Assignment

Welcome to my OOP assignment! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

In this project, I created two parts to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

1. **Smartphone Class**: This part includes a class that represents a smartphone. It has attributes like brand, model, and battery life, and methods to make calls and take photos. I also created a subclass for gaming smartphones.

2. **Polymorphism Challenge**: In this part, I created different vehicle classes (Car, Bicycle, and Plane). Each class has a `move()` method that behaves differently, showing how polymorphism works.

## Files

- `smartphone.py`: Contains the Smartphone class and its subclass.
- `polymorphism_challenge.py`: Contains the vehicle classes demonstrating polymorphism.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the files are located.
3. Run the files using Python:

   ```bash
   python smartphone.py
   python polymorphism_challenge.py
